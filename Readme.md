# Robotic Lab Session Repository
--------------------------------

**A Collaborative Resource Guide for Presenting the Robotic Lab**

Welcome to this repository! This collection of resources and materials was created by me, along with other students who have helped present the Robotic Lab at Shiraz University. The contents of this repository are specifically designed to support future presenters of the lab.

## Requirements
--------------

### Programming Fundamentals

* **C/C++**: Students must have a good understanding of C/C++ programming concepts, including syntax, data types, control structures, functions.
**Don't worry if you're not an expert!** We will only use simple and basic instructions of C/C++ in this lab, so even if you haven't used it before, you'll be able to catch up quickly.

### Programming Environment

* **VSCode**: Students should be comfortable using Visual Studio Code (VSCode).
* **PlatformIO Extensions**: It is highly recommended that students install the PlatformIO extensions within VSCode and **test it** before the sessions starts to facilitate efficient and streamlined development.

## Sessions
